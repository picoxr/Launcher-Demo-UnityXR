# Description
PICO Enterprise devices offer the possibility of setting installed applications as their main launcher app. This is not only useful when setting up a kiosk mode, but also helps when we want the end user access only a set of different apps and options.

- PICO XR SDK 2.4.0
# Dependencies (UPM)

# Example methods
The LauncherUtils.cs class shows how to use several Enterprise SDK methods:

- PXR_Enterprise.StartActivity: https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/reference/unity/latest/PXR_Enterprise/#StartActivity
- PXR_Enterprise.GotoSeeThroughFloorSetting: https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/reference/unity/latest/PXR_Enterprise/#bd4f531c

Note: PXR_Enterprise.SetAPPAsHome requires rebooting the device in order to take effect.
# Demo
In this demo, several Enterprise-level APIs are exposed to the user/developer. We encourage developers to take a look at the PXR_Enterprise apps to check how they can leverage the Enteprise SDK for their use cases.
# Setting up kiosk mode/custom launcher without SDK
## Replace launcher under home screen settings 
To provide more intuitive way of configuring Kiosk Mode, weâ€™ve built a functionality from Pico Business Setting to facilitate Kiosk Mode deployment. The method is described as following: 
1. Click Settings > Developer> Business settings>Home Screen. 
2. Select the application that you want to use for Kiosk Mode. 
3. Reboot the device
